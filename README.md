### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I make sure my code is functional by testing it often and checking that each part works as expected. I use unit tests to confirm that functions handle both valid and invalid inputs correctly. To keep my code secure, I validate user input, handle data carefully, and avoid exposing things like passwords or personal information in the code.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I start by understanding what the user wants to achieve and why. I look at the requirements and think about how someone will actually use the program. Then I design features that solve their problems in a simple and practical way. I also test the program from the user’s point of view to make sure it’s easy to use and meets their expectations.

### How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I plan before I start coding. I break down the problem into smaller parts and decide how they’ll work together. I focus on keeping the design organized and easy to maintain. As I build, I test each part and make small improvements along the way to keep the program clean and reliable.
